    <div><h1>A struggling coder</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my story</h2></div>

    <div><p>My name is John Deakin-Jones. I have dreams and aspirations of becoming a video game designer and programmer.<br>
        I have previous experience in coding XML but I was by no means a professional.<br>
        I am currently expanding my knowledge on a variety of aspects that will aide me in the future, including Python, HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>I also have taken the large step into digital art. I have a very long way to go with this as of now.<br>
        Luckily I have some talented friends who keep me motivated and share tips and tricks!</p>
