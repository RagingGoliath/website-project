    <div><h1>My big dive into game coding</h1></div>

    <div><p>Since before the release of the SEGA MegaDrive I had wished, hoped, prayed and dreamed of becoming a video game maker.<br>
    I has been entranced by the sheer poetry that could be achieved with a video game, even back in the 80s, and dreamed of creating games that people<br>
    would adore. <br>
    Up until a few years ago I had nothing outside of RPG Maker to try to gain the necessary skills. This didn't work to my benefit and I have never been from<br>
    a wealthy family, so it seemed that I had hit a dead end. Until I discovered the Unity engine, which can make creating video games very easily.</p></div>

    <h4>The first complete game I created. A horde survival game.</h4></div>

    <div><p>As you can see from the above pictures, I had a lot to learn and a long way to go (I still do). However, I recently moved away from the FPS<br>
    style game and moved towards virtual reality. My aim being to make the first ever open world MMORPG that is entirely in virtual reality.<br>
    This is a monumental task and will add a lot more to what I need to learn, I already require 3D modelling skills. My 3D models don't look too bad,<br>
    but they are far from optimised.</p></div>
