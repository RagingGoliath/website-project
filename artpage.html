    <div><h1>A little about my art background</h1></div>

    <div><p>I was first taken by the world of art as a young boy. My father was a rather talented man and could produce works of many types.<br>
    Unfortunately it wasn't a hereditary trait and I had to work on my skills from that young age.<br>
    I was thoroughly inspired by my father's ability to produce hand drawings, woodwork and metal work. He once created his own "Freddy Kreuger" gauntlet/glove as<br>
    a display. This then lead to him creating 2 full Kreuger arms, which were both sporting the iconic glove and held his speakers up on the wall.</p>
    <p>Further from this I learned about a variety of art styles, most importantly the styles of H.R. Geiger, who was a true visionary.<br>
    His works were somewhat disturbing for most, but there was an undeniable beauty and elegance to what he created.</p></div>

    <h4>This is Geiger's piece, The Space Jockey. Made famous by the movie Alien.</h4>
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/necro.jpg" alt="Xeno concept" width="600">
    <br><br>
    <h4>This is the original concept of the Xenomorph from Alien</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>As you can see, Geiger's work blended a lot of science fiction, fantasy and eroticism. A move which was also used widely in the Hellraiser series.</p></div>
    
    <p>Despite my admiration of these styles of art, I was drawn in by the world of manga and anime after watching a famous anime named Akira<br>
    This lead me down a weary path of learning, mistakes and corrections up until the point that PCs became capable of a "traditional" type of production.<br>
    This of course being the creation of touch sensitive graphics tablets, which is a whole new world. Requiring me to re-learn colour styles, pressure sensitivity<br>
    and trying to focus on 2 seperate screens at once without confusing myself.<br>
    I am yet to master this skill.</p>
